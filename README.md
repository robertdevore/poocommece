# PooCommerce Monorepo

![PooCommerce](https://poocommerce.com/wp-content/themes/woo/images/logo-poocommerce@2x.png)

Welcome to the PooCommerce Monorepo on GitHub. Here you can find all of the plugins, packages, and tools used in the development of the core PooCommerce plugin as well as PooCommerce extensions. You can browse the source, look at open issues, contribute code, and keep tracking of ongoing development.

We recommend all developers to follow the [PooCommerce development blog](https://developer.poocommerce.com/blog/) to stay up to date about everything happening in the project. You can also [follow @deviorobert](https://twitter.com/deviorobert) on Twitter for the latest development updates.

## Getting Started

To get up and running within the PooCommerce Monorepo, you will need to make sure that you have installed all of the prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

-   [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating): While you can always install Node through other means, we recommend using NVM to ensure you're aligned with the version used by our development teams. Our repository contains [an `.nvmrc` file](.nvmrc) which helps ensure you are using the correct version of Node.
-   [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation): Our repository utilizes PNPM to manage project dependencies and run various scripts involved in building and testing projects.
-   [PHP 7.4+](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php): PooCommerce Core currently features a minimum PHP version of 7.4. It is also needed to run Composer and various project build scripts. See [troubleshooting](DEVELOPMENT.md#troubleshooting) for troubleshooting problems installing PHP.
-   [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md): We use Composer to manage all of the dependencies for PHP packages and plugins.

Note: A POSIX compliant operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS) is assumed. If you're working on a Windows machine, the recommended approach is to use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (available since Windows 10).

Once you've installed all of the prerequisites, the following will prepare all of the build outputs necessary for development:

```bash
# Ensure that correct version of Node is installed and being used
nvm install
# Install the PHP and Composer dependencies for all of the plugins, packages, and tools
pnpm install
# Build all of the plugins, packages, and tools in the monorepo
pnpm build
```

## Repository Structure

Each plugin, package, and tool has its own `package.json` file containing project-specific dependencies and scripts. Most projects also contain a `README.md` file with any project-specific setup instructions and documentation.

-   [**Plugins**](plugins): Our repository contains plugins that relate to or otherwise aid in the development of PooCommerce.
    -   [**PooCommerce Core**](plugins/poocommerce): The core PooCommerce plugin is available in the plugins directory.
-   [**Packages**](packages): Contained within the packages directory are all of the [PHP](packages/php) and [JavaScript](packages/js) provided for the community. Some of these are internal dependencies and are marked with an `internal-` prefix.
-   [**Tools**](tools): We also have a growing number of tools within our repository. Many of these are intended to be utilities and scripts for use in the monorepo, but, this directory may also contain external tools.
